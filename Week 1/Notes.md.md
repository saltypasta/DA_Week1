## Github
- I am set up on Github already thanks to Digital History!

## Hypothes.is
- I am set up on Hypothes.is already thanks to Digital History! I joined the group and I am able to see the annotations other students are leaving on the course website etc. 

## Zotero
- I have used Zotero for other classes before, so I have it set up as well. This will come in handy for the #Exitticket

## Obsidian
- I have Obsidian installed from Digital history, and I am using it to write my materials instead of Atom this time around. I want to capitalize on Obsidians ability to connect my thoughts to my other notes through the # function. I see myself using this a lot to connect my #Log materials to my #reflection Materials
